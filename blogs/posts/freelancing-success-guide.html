                    <h2>Why Freelancing is the Future of Work</h2>

                    <p>The freelancing economy is booming. According to recent studies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Over 57 million Americans freelance (36% of the workforce)</li>
                        <li>Freelancers contribute $1.27 trillion to the U.S. economy annually</li>
                        <li>By 2027, the majority of the U.S. workforce will be freelancing</li>
                        <li>Remote work has accelerated the adoption of freelance talent</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Personal Experience</h4>
                        <p>When I started freelancing 6+ months ago, I had no clients, no portfolio, and limited experience. Today, I work with 15+ happy clients and have completed 25+ projects. The key is starting with the right foundation and being persistent.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Step 1: Choose Your Freelancing Niche</h2>

                    <h2>Step 3: Set Up Your Freelancing Business</h2>

                    <p>Treating freelancing as a business from day one sets you up for long-term success.</p>

                    <h3>Business Setup Checklist:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Legal Structure:</strong> Decide on sole proprietorship, LLC, etc.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>Step 4: Price Your Services Strategically</h2>

                    <p>Pricing is one of the most challenging aspects of freelancing. Price too low, and you'll struggle to make a living. Price too high, and you might scare away potential clients.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i> Pricing Formula</h4>
                        <p>Start with this formula: (Desired Annual Income + Business Expenses + Taxes) ÷ Billable Hours = Hourly Rate. Then adjust based on market rates and your experience level.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Pricing Strategies:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hourly Rates:</strong> Good for ongoing work and new freelancers</li>
                        <li><strong>Project-Based:</strong> Better for experienced freelancers</li>
                        <li><strong>Value-Based:</strong> Price based on client results and ROI</li>
                        <li><strong>Retainer Agreements:</strong> Guaranteed monthly income</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Step 5: Find Your First Clients</h2>

                    <p>Getting your first clients is often the hardest part of freelancing. Here are proven strategies that work:</p>

                    <h3>Crafting Winning Proposals:</h3>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>Step 6: Deliver Exceptional Work</h2>

                    <h2>Step 7: Scale Your Freelancing Business</h2>

                    <p>Once you have steady clients and income, it's time to scale your business for greater success.</p>

                    <h3>Scaling Strategies:</h3>
